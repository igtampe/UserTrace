# UserTrace

A quick C# Tree viewer/editor to display by whom and when a user was invited to a Discord Server. UserTrace stores all necessary information in a folder, comprised of a server logo image, a tiled background image, another folder for images of profile pictures, a Dictionary On Disk file for users, and a [Dictionary On Disk](https://github.com/igtampe/DictionaryOnDisk) file for project information (Saved as Project.UTrace).

The result? A nice poster/talking point for any discord server, even if it does take a little work to do.
